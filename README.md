# Hong-Kong Horse Race Betting Model

## Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a profitable betting model, focused on beating the highly efficient Hong-Kong horse race betting market. This was undertaken as a summer project to help exercise my predictive modeling skills. 

## Data Collection
Data was sourced from *Horse Racing in HK*, a Kaggle dataset found at: https://www.kaggle.com/gdaley/hkracing/data. The raw data contains two files, races.csv and runs.csv. races.csv contains information regarding the overall race, such as date, venue, distance, winnings, etc. runs.csv focuses on the specific runs of each horse, and contains data such as sectional times and horse information.
