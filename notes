Done:
- Did a quick data analysis
- Removed uncommon races and distance and venue combos
- Set all lengths_behind times > 70 to the average loser value
- Added num of horses in a race
- Added horse win percent
- Added trainer win percent
- Added raw speed ratings
- Added track variant
- Added speed ratings
- Add win percent for jockey
- Emailed Charles
- Added normalized results for trainer, jockey, horse
- Added trainer jockey relationship
- Added going rating

Next Steps:
- 

- Look at the engineering analysis
    - Find the distances to the posts
    
    
Email to charles:
- Mention that I have listened to both podcasts
    - Very interesting to hear from ppl that do this professionally + academically
    - Interesting bc maybe I will see myself there one day
    - Found the academic particularly interesting
    
- Seem to imply that it is a very hard thing to get postitive ROI on. Especially because I have no exotic bets in my data
- Mention my goal for this project, ask him what he thinks a reasonable goal for results is
    
- Explain how to take into account odds / ask how I should use them
- Mention I have tried other scaling methods that seem to be worse then the one I am using
    
Things to think about:
- outliers in the data
    - Remove based on uncommon race class
    - Remove horses that do not finish (999 lengths behind)
